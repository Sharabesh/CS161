# CS161 - Introduction to Computer Security
This repository contains all of my coursework from the CS161 Course at UC Berkeley. I completed the course in the Spring of 2017. All of the projects were completed in Python 3.

## Projects Completed:

(1) **Calnet Hack - Buffer Management** - A task of hacking into a Virtual Machine by exploiting 4 vulnerabilities in code (related to buffer management and stack address modification) in order to gain root privileges (to obtain a keyword) -- *https://www.icir.org/vern/cs161-sp17/projects/project1-problems.pdf*

(2) **Secure File Store** - A design construction and implementation of a secure file store, which can be used to store files securely and share files with others (focus was on maintaining confidentiality & integrity and utilizing both symmetric- and asymmetric-key encryption methods, as appropriate) -- *https://www.icir.org/vern/cs161-sp17/projects/encrypted-file-store/project2-problems.pdf*

(3) **Calnet Hack - SSL/TLS** - A task of (once again) hacking into a Virtual Machine by exploiting 4 key vulnerabilities, all based on common network security faults (involved decrypting SSL traffic, performing man-in-the-middle attacks on TLS connections, etc.) -- *https://www.icir.org/vern/cs161-sp17/projects/project3-problems.pdf*
